Mauth (pronounced Moth) is a Two-Factor Authentication app with support for TOTP and HOTP and compatibility with Google Authenticator. It comes with a rich UI while also providing many necessary features.

Features:

Mauth uses latest Android technology (Jetpack Compose, CameraX, Biometrics, Room DB and more) to provide the best user experience with the least amount of bugs possible. It is in an active development but is nowhere near ready for daily usage. Use it at your own risk.
