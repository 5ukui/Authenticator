v0.5.0

New features
============
- Added a settings page
  - Includes a "Secure Mode" switch that protects you from exposing data via screenshots
- `otpauth://` deeplink support
- Added a splash screen for devices running on Android 11 and below
- Turkish translation

Changes
=======
- Small UI updates
	- "Full-screen" immersive navigation and top bars
	- Animated code display
	- Remove placeholder icon buttons in home bottom bar
	- Updates to account card
- 90% of the app was rewritten from scratch! This should result in a better performance and will make subsequent updates much easier

Bug fixes
=========
- Fixed a bug where camera would not properly close after exiting the QR Scan screen
- Fixed many possible crashes

*Note: due to changes to the app's database, a complex migration was written to convert from the old schema to the new one. Please report issues if Mauth starts crashing or accounts disappear after updating to v0.5.0*
